[here goes a gif explaining what this repository is about]

**!! This repository contains the code for my bachelor degree thesis project.**

*setlog-picat* is a pure implementation of [{log}] (read setlog) in [picat]. This work is related to the {log} 
project.

{log} project aims at the design and development of a Constraint Logic Programming language that embodies the
fundamental forms of set designation and a number of primitive operations for set management.
